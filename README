Data-Structure-Compare

use Data::Structure::Compare qw(hash_compare hashes_to_hash 
                                hash_to_hashes_json);

Perl is similar to process string, Transfer Complex data structure
to simple data structure, Then could use Perl's string process ability to
parse Complex data structure.

my $data1 = { 1 => { 2 => 3} };
my $data2 = { 1 => { 2 => 4} };

if (hash_compare($data1, $data2) == 1) {
    print '$data1 and $data2 have same structure';
}

When we validate some data with same XSD rules, We need only compare the structure.

When we compare two complex data structure, it is difficult to compare one
by one key and value.

Test::Deep only could compare same structure with same value.
sometimes we only need compare structure.
